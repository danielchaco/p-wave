PRSN estimation of Vs30 velocity based on waveform data

## Meibai Li, 04/14/2022
An adaptation of the Meibai Li method to estimate the Vs30 velocity is proposed. The   
Using the Obspy library, a new procedure to read and plot the PRSN waveforms data was established. The resulted data can be processed according to Meibai Li to estimate the Vsz and then convert it to Vs30.
